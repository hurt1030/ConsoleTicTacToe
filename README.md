# Tic Tac Toe
This is a text-based tic-tac-toe console application intended as a mechanism for me to re-learn C++ because I didn't retain much of what I learned of it in school.

In this project I mostly focused on refreshing my knowledge on I/O and basic syntax regarding functions, classes, control flow, etc.
